# Mod-Pack-Maker

unzip the setup folder  
in side you will find setup.bat and Mega Pack Maker.bat  
move the Mega Pack Maker to your desktop  
run the setup.bat  
you will get a new folder on your desktop called Minecraft   
in side that you will find Minecraft, ignore, and mods  
LEAVE THESE ALONE  
use the mega pack maker to edit these files
